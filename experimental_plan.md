Perform tests with synthetic networks to see how the algorithm scales as the input size increases. 

Use Igraph or some other tool to generate synthetic networks.

Measure the performance of other centrality measures on these same synthetic networks. Compare the quality of their most central vertices between each measure. 

Try to run your algorithm on some real world networks, show that it stops running at a certain size. If this information is bad, at least use table.
